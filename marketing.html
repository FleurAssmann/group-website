	<h3>CONTEXT OF CAMPAIGN & PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES</h3>
		  <p class="p2">To achieve our marketing objectives, PEARL has conducted 1 TikTok campaign and 4 Instagram campaigns. <br><br>

On TikTok, we have posted a video. In the video, you see people who all look different and are all unique in their own way, yet they feel connected. They are having fun, laughing, and chilling together. This shows that no matter who you are and how you look, everyone is accepted.<br><br>

On Instagram we have conducted 4 different campaigns:<br><br>
Introduction PEARL campaign<br>
With this campaign, we introduced our brand to the audience by showing our logo and our brand's vision.<br><br>
PEARL’s quotes campaign<br>
After introducing our brand, we started to make the audience curious by posting quotes about our topic. We have also posted videos where you can clearly see that every person in this world is different. The audience can attach their own meaning to this and arouses curiosity.<br><br>
PEARL hoodies campaign<br>
After arousing the curiosity of the viewers, it was time to introduce our hoodies. Within 3 Instagram posts, we have shown the audience our hoodies, in 6 different colors.<br><br>
PEARL’s response campaign<br>
To measure the response from our target audience, we created two polls in our Instagram stories with two questions about our hoodies.<br>
1. Would you buy this hoodie? 69% said YES, 25% said MAYBE, 6% said IN ANOTHER COLOR<br>
2. How do these hoodies make you feel? 45% said WARM HEARTED, 9% said APPRECIATED, 45% said UNIQUE</p><br>
			  
<h5>MARKETING OBJECTIVES</h5>
<p class="p2">“We want to reach 300 people with our brand message before the 14th of April 2022”
→ 250 people will view our TikTok, 50 will view our Instagram
To be specific, our TikTok reached 374 views before the 14th of April, and our Instagram was viewed 118 times in the week from 7 till the 14th of April.<br><br>

“We want 150 people to be curious after viewing our brand message before the 19th of April”
To measure if people were curious after viewing our brand message, we used the Instagram polls. We did not achieve 150 people being curious enough after reading our brand message.<br><br>

“We want 100 likes and 25 comments on our social media before the 19th of April”
Our campaigns went very well. Our goal of 100 likes was easily achieved, with about 300 likes in total. The 25 comments have become 80 in total, much more than we wanted! 
</p><br>

		  <h3>LEARNING POINTS</h3>
		  <p class="p2">
		  At the start of the project, we spent too long establishing our brand, due to many doubts and no concrete plans, which meant that we couldn't work out our Communication & Media plan well. Because of this, we started a little late with launching our campaigns which prevented us from spreading it properly. For example, this resulted in multiple posts in 1 day or 2 days. As a result, we noticed that there were fewer likes or responses to certain campaigns.<br><br>

Secondly, we did not achieve our affect objective, because of not understanding it clearly. We figured that “making people curious” is not specific enough, how do you make someone curious and how do you measure it? A learning point for us is to be more specific with our objectives and see if it can be achieved at all.<br><br>

What came as a surprise to us was the number of likes, comments, and followers we received on the Instagram app. We shared it a lot, especially with people outside of BUas, and they all responded very enthusiastically. Many people even thought it was actually going to be produced and wondered where to order it. We noticed that people who were unfamiliar with the project, ie not fellow CB students, responded more and were more enthusiastic. This is also a learning point for us, and we will certainly continue to promote it in this way in the future.<br><br>

On the website page, the learning points are identified and justified (based on the Communication & Media Plan). What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn’t? What went as expected and what didn’t? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you learned.
		  </p><br>
		  
		  <h3>FUTURE PLANNING</h3>
		  <p class="p2">
		  As we stated before, we would have started earlier with posting the content on our social media platforms. If the project would continue, we’ve added a future content calender in our justification document with a whole list of what we would do next. Some examples were:<br><br>
- Instagram story with the availability in percentages pie chart from the most popular hoodie from that week.<br><br>
- Posting a photo of all different kinds of people together with the caption: “All people are so different and still the same. Dare to be unique. Name something in the comments that makes you unique.” <br><br>
- A future recommendation would be that we should think more out of the box with the campaigns. Not only use Illustrator or a photo and post it online but try to go outside and be more creative in the real world.
</p><br>
		  <h3>PROFESSIONALISM</h3>
		  <p class="p2">
		  All our campaigns are presented below. PEARL worked with the same style that fits with the logo, image and vision. Images on the site are high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
